====== Events ======

Events are everywhere, they are as simple as
--------------------
player.addEventCallback(EVENT_CLASS, event -> {
   // Do your event things
});
--------------------

for example:
--------------------
player.addEventCallback(PlayerBlockInteractEvent.class, event -> {
   if (event.getHand() != Player.Hand.MAIN)
	  return;

   short blockId = player.getInstance().getBlockId(event.getBlockPosition());
   Block block = Block.fromId(blockId);
   player.sendMessage("You clicked at the block " + block);
});
--------------------

Basics events are listed at https://github.com/Minestom/Minestom/tree/master/src/main/java/net/minestom/server/event

The recommended way of how and where to put the listeners is by using ConnectionManager#addPlayerInitialization, it is basically called just after the player object is created.
--------------------
ConnectionManager connectionManager = MinecraftServer.getConnectionManager();
connectionManager.addPlayerInitialization(player -> {
   // Do what you want with the player
   // player.addEventCallback ...
});
--------------------

==== Create a custom event ====

In order to do so, you need a class which extends Event or CancellableEvent and finally call it by doing
--------------------
MyCustomEvent customEvent = new MyCustomEvent();
player.callEvent(MyCustomEvent.class, customEvent);
--------------------

You can then retrieve data from your event object and do whatever you want with it.
